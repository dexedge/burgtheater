Dark vertical lines in each box show the median receipts for the selected composers or titles. The height of a box is proportional to the number of performances. The left and right borders of a box are the 25th and 75th percentiles. Individual points are outliers more than 1.5 times the interquartile range above the 75th percentile. The boxes are sorted by descending median receipts. 

For individual titles, a long thin box is characteristic of a flop: a small number of performances, with a large fall-off in receipts after the first performance. (Examples are Weigl's *La quacquera spirituosa* and Paisiello's *Nina*.)
